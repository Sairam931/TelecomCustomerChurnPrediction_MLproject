# TelecomCustomerChurnPrediction_MLproject
Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications Companies - ML

Conducted in-depth analysis of technical details related to the business case, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developed a predictive model using Google Colab. Presented data insights and outcomes to stakeholders, resulting in a better understanding of customer churn and improved decision-making.
Identified and addressed outliers in an imbalanced dataset for customer churn analysis. Utilized various machine learning models including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, Ada boost, and XG boost. Achieved highest accuracy of 96% with the random forest model.
Utilized multiple algorithms to develop a predictive model for customer churn and selected the best-performing model with the highest accuracy score. Presented overall models and interpretations to senior scientists, leading to their endorsement of the chosen model. Deployed the model globally using streamlit framework for widespread usage across the organization.
